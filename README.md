Trigger-Phrase-Replacer-for-Chrome
=============

Functionality
------------
Replaces any given word or phrase with a different one throughout your browsing experience. 

Extension must have permission to view and edit all the pages you visit, which is why its so important that it be open source and publicly hosted.  


Future-Functionality
------------
Simple user GUI to choose which word / phrase is replaced, and how. 

Until I add this functionality, this extension is absolutely the same as 'Cloud to Butt' just with arbitrary word changes that are neither funny nor useful to anyone but the author.


About
------------

Forked from 'Cloud to Butt', an extension that replaces occurrences of the phrase "the cloud" with "my butt"

It was a funny extension. But I needed a more serious one that would allow me to trade out some names and phrases that were triggering bad reactions.  I realised I probably wasn't the only one who would like this functionality in chrome.
